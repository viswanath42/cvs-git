This is a sample of text for the quick
start tutorial for using CVS.

This file lives in the directory cvsexample.
It will be updated when you type "cvs update"
from the directory cvsexample.  

If a subdirectory like cartilage is added, and
"cvs update" is run from within the subdirectory,
this file will not be updated.

There will be some edits to this file in the
tutorial!

This is the first text that was added.  

Now we add a paragraph with some substance:

MRI is a particularly exciting field of medical
imaging, for many reasons.  MRI of articular cartilage 
is without a doubt the most important sub-field of MRI.  
Osteoarthritis is the second leading cause of disability 
after heart disease.  Steady state imaging sequences are
a new area that is being explored for this application.

That's the end of the paragraph with substance!
