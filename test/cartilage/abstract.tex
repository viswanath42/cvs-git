The high prevalence of osteoarthritis continues to
demand methods of diagnosing cartilage lesions, for which 
MRI is the most accurate non-invasive option.
There has been renewed interest
in SNR-efficient imaging sequences for
imaging cartilage, including various forms of
steady-state free precession
as well as driven equilibrium Fourier Transform.  
We compare several of these sequences with existing
methods, both theoretically and in normal volunteers.  Results
show that the new steady-state methods have high potential for
knee imaging.
