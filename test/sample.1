This is a sample of text for the quick
start tutorial for using CVS.

This file lives in the directory cvsexample.
It will be updated when you type "cvs update"
from the directory cvsexample.  

If a subdirectory like cartilage is added, and
"cvs update" is run from within the subdirectory,
this file will not be updated.

There will be some edits to this file in the
tutorial!

This is the first text that was added.
